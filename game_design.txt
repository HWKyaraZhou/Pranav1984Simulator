Game Story:

-Players start as working in the Ministry of Truth. They can be either an editor of
history, a surveillance officer, or a propaganda developer.

-At Ministry of Truth, players interact with typewriters, redactors, and propaganda 
distribution machines
	-Each work area holds the potential for eavesdropping or spying on co-workers

-Telescreens interrupt gameplay randomly with notices or to check player loyalty. If 
telescreen catches during a rebellious action, the suspicion increases.

-Initially, they get very mundane and repetitive tasks but eventually get faced with 
ethically conflicting tasks such as rewriting history or creating propaganda. 

-Players have a loyalty meter and a rebellion meter. Increasing the loyalty meter decreases
suspicion but aligns you closer with the Party and brings you further from joining the
rebellion. Increasing the rebellion meter increases suspicion but brings you closer to 
joining the rebellion and getting freedom. Players also have a survival meter that depends
on how much food and supplies they have.

-Big Brother AI tracks players actions and raids home and brainwashes if too many
rebellious activities. Rewards such as food or supplies for loyal actions.

-Along the way, players get document fragments that reveal parts of the real truth that
can unlock paths to the rebellion. They also build relationships with the NPCs in both
the rebellion and those who are in the Party, which increases their loyalty meter or 
rebellion meter.

-Players play doublethink minigames in which they need to remember the real truth in the
face of the Party's truth. As loyalty increases, player's experience distortion where
real truths are blurred, while they become clearer as rebellion increases.

-End game outcomes: 
	-Loyalist ending: Player becomes too closely aligned with teh Party and is permanently
	working for Big Brother OR player becomes too rebellious and gets brainwashed by 
	Big Brother
	-Rebellion ending: Player successfully joins the rebellion, but with high risk of
	capture and torture
